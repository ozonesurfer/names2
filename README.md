A simple example of a Dart website using IndexedDB  

You will need the Dart environment to build and run this code. You can download it from 

[https://www.dartlang.org/](https://www.dartlang.org/)

Use the Dart Editor to open the repository folder. Wait for the Editor to finish analyzing the project. 
You might need to increase the value of the _version member in the NameList class in order to erase my data. Once the
Editor has finished construsting the scaffolding and the database version number is set, the project should be ready to run.
